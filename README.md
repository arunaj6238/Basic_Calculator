# basic_calculator
The provided Python program is a basic calculator that takes user input for two numbers (a and b) and an operator (o). It performs arithmetic operations based on the operator and prints the result.

++++	Division by Zero Check:

Specifically checks for division ("/") and ensures that the second number (b) is not zero before performing the division. Handles the division by zero case to avoid errors.

++++	Error Handling:

Prints an error message if the operator is not recognized, indicating that an error has occurred.


Then, it checks the operator using if and elif statements to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and prints the result. The code also includes a check to avoid division by zero.
